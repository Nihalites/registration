2. Enter a username (at least 3 characters long).
3. Enter a valid email address.
4. Enter a password (at least 6 characters long).
5. Click the "Submit" button.
6. If validation passes, an alert will show "Registration successful!"
7. If validation fails, error messages will be displayed under the respective input fields.
